See <http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/index.html>.

All CODATA recommended values are defined as a constant and as a
function.  The function returns three values, the value of the
constant, the standard uncertainty, and the relative standard
uncertainty.  Floating-point numbers are of the type `long-float'.
Please note that some of the constants have values which can not be
represented as IEEE 754 single precision floating-point numbers.

This package also exports the symbols of the 2010 CODATA recommended
values."))

Argument SYMBOL is the symbol of a recommended value.

Value is the string representation of the recommended value, or nil
if SYMBOL is not a valid symbol of a recommended value.

The string representation uses the letter E as the exponent char."
