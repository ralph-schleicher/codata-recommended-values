CODATA-RECOMMENDED-VALUES

CODATA recommended values of physical constants.

See <http://physics.nist.gov/cuu/index.html>.

All CODATA recommended values are defined as a constant and as a
function.  The function returns three values, the value of the
constant, the standard uncertainty, and the relative standard
uncertainty.  Floating-point numbers are of the type ‘long-float’.
Please note that some of the constants have values which can not be
represented as IEEE 754 single precision floating-point numbers.

This package also exports the symbols of the 2018 CODATA recommended
values.

                                                                      [Function]
string-value (symbol)
   Return the string representation of a recommended value.

   Argument SYMBOL is the symbol of a recommended value.

   Value is the string representation of the recommended value, or nil
   if SYMBOL is not a valid symbol of a recommended value.

   The string representation uses the letter E as the exponent char.
